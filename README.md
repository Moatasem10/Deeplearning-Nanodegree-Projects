# Deeplearning-Nanodegree-Projects

A 3 months deep learning course at which I studied the following topic:

1 - Neural Networks

2 - CNNs

3 - RNNs

4 - GANs

5 - Implementing and Deploying a model using AWS.

also I developed these 5 guided projects during the nanodegree :

1 - Predicting a Bike-Sharing patterns using neural networks

2 - A Dog-Breed classifier using CNNs

3 - Generate TV scripts using RNNs

4 - Generate human faces using GANs

5 - Deploying a web app which classifies a movie review either positive or negative on AWS.
